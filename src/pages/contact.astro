        This is a React island. The `client:load` directive tells Astro
        to hydrate this component on the client immediately.
        
        Other options:
        - client:visible - hydrate when the component enters the viewport
        - client:idle - hydrate when the browser is idle
        - client:media="(max-width: 768px)" - hydrate on media query match
      -->
